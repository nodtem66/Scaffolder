Transform a 3D model from STL/PLY/OFF/OBJ to a porous model with implicit function (e.g., Schwarz P/ Gyroid).

## Binary installation
* Download from [Github Releases page](https://github.com/nodtem66/Scaffolder/releases) or
* Install from Anaconda
```bash
conda install -c nodtem66 scaffolder
```

## Python supports
```bash
pip install PyScaffolder
```

## Blender addon
- Install the `Scaffolder-blender.zip` downloaded from [Release](https://github.com/nodtem66/Scaffolder/releases/tag/v1.5.1)
- The plugin will appear at `View > Sidebar` or `Press N`

## Dependencies
- [libigl](https://libigl.github.io/) - The computational geometry library
- [vcglib](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib) - The mesh utility library
- [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) - Lua script integration
- [tbb](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) - Threading library

## How it works
- Read STL file and finding the boundary box
- Generate the grid and calculate the winding number with STL mesh
- Use winding number to determine the condition for [implicit isosurface function](https://wewanttolearn.wordpress.com/2019/02/03/triply-periodic-minimal-surfaces/)
- Generate the isosurface field in the same-size grid
- Perform [Dual marching cube](https://github.com/dominikwodniok/dualmc) to construct the manifold
- Clean up the duplicated vertices or faces, and abandon the group of connected faces having the diameter below the setting
- Export to the target 3D format

## FAQ

### How can I find the dataset from a study of coffient and isolevel?
The raw dataset is available at [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/sbxr7xxvnd/2).
The program that used to generate that data was released at [Github repository](https://github.com/nodtem66/Scaffolder). You can also find the interactive visualization at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nodtem66/Scaffolder/blob/master/data/data_visualization.ipynb)

### Where is the implicit functions were defined in the C++ sourcecode?
https://github.com/nodtem66/Scaffolder/blob/master/include/implicit_function.h

### Can you suggest alternative softwares like this program?
- Rhino (Grasshopper)
- nTopology
- Hyperganic
